# Bao
Bao is a simple command line utility to write text output to a specified file. To use, first specify the file name you'd like to write, then the string to write to the file. Here's a simple example to get you started;

    Bao example.txt "Hello World!"

If the file name or string you'd like to write is multiple words, simply wrap it in quotes('') or double quotes("") as seen above.
