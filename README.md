# Bao
Bao is a simple command line utility to write text output to a specified file. To use, first specify the file name you'd like to write, then the string to write to the file. Here's a simple example to get you started;

    Bao example.txt "Hello World!"

If the file name or string you'd like to write is multiple words, simply wrap it in quotes('') or double quotes("") as seen above.

# Installation
To install, simply run the following command;

    sudo curl -L -o /usr/bin/Bao raw.githubusercontent.com/tapebysea/Bao/refs/heads/main/Bao && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/Bao

More features may be added in the future if it makes sense.
